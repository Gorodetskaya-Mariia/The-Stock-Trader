# the-stock-trader

> A Vue.js project

The application consists of three pages. You can buy as many stocks as you can afford on the page "Stocks". The page "Portfolio" displays all stocks which you have bought. Also, you may Save and Load your data. Click on "End Day" to update prices of every stock. You may sell your stocks and get a profit or a loss. You can find a similar information on the "Home" page.
